-- Portability :  non-portable (requires concurrency)
--
-- This module provides a set of operations for running IO operations
-- asynchronously and waiting for their results.  It is a thin layer
-- over the basic concurrency operations provided by
-- "Control.Concurrent".  The main additional functionality it
-- provides is the ability to wait for the return value of a thread,
-- but the interface also provides some additional safety and
-- robustness over using threads and @MVar@ directly.
--
-- The basic type is @'Async' a@, which represents an asynchronous
-- @IO@ action that will return a value of type @a@, or die with an
-- exception.  An @Async@ corresponds to a thread, and its 'ThreadId'
-- can be obtained with 'asyncThreadId', although that should rarely
-- be necessary.
--
-- For example, to fetch two web pages at the same time, we could do
-- this (assuming a suitable @getURL@ function):
--
-- >    do a1 <- async (getURL url1)
-- >       a2 <- async (getURL url2)
-- >       page1 <- wait a1
-- >       page2 <- wait a2
-- >       ...
--
-- where 'async' starts the operation in a separate thread, and
-- 'wait' waits for and returns the result.  If the operation
-- throws an exception, then that exception is re-thrown by
-- 'wait'.  This is one of the ways in which this library
-- provides some additional safety: it is harder to accidentally
-- forget about exceptions thrown in child threads.
--
-- A slight improvement over the previous example is this:
--
-- >       withAsync (getURL url1) $ \a1 -> do
-- >       withAsync (getURL url2) $ \a2 -> do
-- >       page1 <- wait a1
-- >       page2 <- wait a2
-- >       ...
--
-- 'withAsync' is like 'async', except that the 'Async' is
-- automatically killed (using 'cancel') if the enclosing IO operation
-- returns before it has completed.  Consider the case when the first
-- 'wait' throws an exception; then the second 'Async' will be
-- automatically killed rather than being left to run in the
-- background, possibly indefinitely.  This is the second way that the
-- library provides additional safety: using 'withAsync' means we can
-- avoid accidentally leaving threads running.  Furthermore,
-- 'withAsync' allows a tree of threads to be built, such that
-- children are automatically killed if their parents die for any
-- reason.
--
-- The pattern of performing two IO actions concurrently and waiting
-- for their results is packaged up in a combinator 'concurrently', so
-- we can further shorten the above example to:
--
-- >       (page1, page2) <- concurrently (getURL url1) (getURL url2)
-- >       ...
--
-- The 'Functor' instance can be used to change the result of an
-- 'Async'.  For example:
--
-- > ghci> a <- async (return 3)
-- > ghci> wait a
-- > 3
-- > ghci> wait (fmap (+1) a)
-- > 4
